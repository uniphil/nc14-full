"George and friend/colleague Parker Mitchell stewarded the organization "

"members, 50,000 supporters, 37 chapters in Canada and change ventures in "
"Malawi, Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, and Zambia.</p>\n"
"          <p>George is now the sole CEO of an organization with "

"businesses, governments and organizations. They drive EWB’s change "
"ventures, working to help local leaders and entrepreneurs create bottom-"
"up, disruptive innovations that address systemic causes of poverty. EWB "
"is also a ‘torch’ for engineers and social change in Canada. George and "
"Parker believed that the engineering profession had a greater role to "
"play in society, and that EWB could lead a movement of socially-minded "
"engineers. EWB’s Canadian change ventures include Canada’s largest "
"grassroots advocacy network on international issues and partnerships to "
"change undergraduate curriculum for 20,000 students, transforming them "
"into Global Engineers.</p>\n"
"          <p>Through EWB, George inspires an ever-growing network of "

"He was awarded the Young Leaders Award by the Public Policy Forum (2007),"
" named as one of Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 (2005) and awarded the "
