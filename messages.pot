"George and friend/colleague Parker Mitchell stewarded the organization "

"members, 50,000 supporters, 37 chapters in Canada and change ventures in "
"Malawi, Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, and Zambia.</p>\n"
"          <p>George is now the sole CEO of an organization with "

"businesses, governments and organizations. They drive EWB’s change "
"ventures, working to help local leaders and entrepreneurs create bottom-"
"up, disruptive innovations that address systemic causes of poverty. EWB "
"is also a ‘torch’ for engineers and social change in Canada. George and "
"Parker believed that the engineering profession had a greater role to "
"play in society, and that EWB could lead a movement of socially-minded "
"engineers. EWB’s Canadian change ventures include Canada’s largest "
"grassroots advocacy network on international issues and partnerships to "
"change undergraduate curriculum for 20,000 students, transforming them "
"into Global Engineers.</p>\n"
"          <p>Through EWB, George inspires an ever-growing network of "

"He was awarded the Young Leaders Award by the Public Policy Forum (2007),"
" named as one of Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 (2005) and awarded the "

"a processing unit for fruits and vegetables. Tamaiko Enterprise works to "
"include the community in decision making by employing people from the "
"communities in which they work, especially women. Faiza, the youngest "
"family member employed by Tamaiko Enterprise, has been working in the "
"family business since she was 12. Over the past two years, Faiza has "
"grown the business into one of the biggest nursery plant suppliers in the"
" region. As a result, she is now the vice-president of the Mango Growers "
"Association and a delegate to represent a group of producers on the "
"Technical Review Committee that was set up by the Ministry of Trade and "
"Industry to encourage development of agricultural production. As she has "
