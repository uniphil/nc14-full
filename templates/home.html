For George Roter, it meant dropping out of his Master’s program and running up $30,000 in credit card debt to fund the launch of Engineers Without Borders Canada (EWB) – that turned out to be a good decision. As EWB’s co-founders, George and friend/colleague Parker Mitchell stewarded the organization from an idea scribbled on a napkin to global influence with 3,000 active members, 50,000 supporters, 37 chapters in Canada and change ventures in Malawi, Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, and Zambia.</p>
          <p>George is now the sole CEO of an organization with volunteers and staff that have been embedded in more than 150 African businesses, governments and organizations. They drive EWB’s change ventures, working to help local leaders and entrepreneurs create bottom-up, disruptive innovations that address systemic causes of poverty. EWB is also a ‘torch’ for engineers and social change in Canada. George and Parker believed that the engineering profession had a greater role to play in society, and that EWB could lead a movement of socially-minded engineers. EWB’s Canadian change ventures include Canada’s largest grassroots advocacy network on international issues and partnerships to change undergraduate curriculum for 20,000 students, transforming them into Global Engineers.</p>
          <p>Through EWB, George inspires an ever-growing network of change leaders who are dedicated to making disruptive, positive change. He was awarded the Young Leaders Award by the Public Policy Forum (2007), named as one of Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 (2005) and awarded the prestigious Action Canada Fellowship (2004) on public policy. He’s was also recognized by Time magazine as one of Canada’s next generation of social leaders (2001).</p>
          <p>George holds a Bachelor of Applied Science from the University of Waterloo (1999), a Bachelor of Applied Studies (Honorary) from Seneca College (2009) and a Doctorate of Applied Science (Honorary) from Queen’s University.
