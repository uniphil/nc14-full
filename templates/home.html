          <p>Fail Forward<br/>Read bio &raquo;</p>
        </a>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>Before launching Fail Forward, Ashley worked in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Canada. In both lines of work, Ashley saw a fear of failure inhibit innovation, adaptation, and general growth. In response, she launched both AdmittingFailure.com and the consulting firm, Fail Forward, to spark a shift in how civil society perceives and talks about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience.</p>
          <p>Ashley has spent the past three years working with a range of organizations from donors and foundations to not-for-profits and private sector companies to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and continuing to lead the development of their annual Failure Report.</p>
          <p>Her work on failure has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including the  Stanford Social Innovation Review, The Guardian, Harvard University’s Hauser Center for NonProfit Organizations, TED talks, BBC World, The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail and, most recently in interview with Arlene Dickinson on CBC.  Ashley was also the 2013 recipient of the prestigious Harvard Business Review and McKinsey Innovating Innovation Award.</p>

          <p>Engineers Without Borders<br/>Read bio &raquo;</p>
        </a>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>What does it mean to be the CEO of a movement? For George Roter, it meant dropping out of his Master’s program and running up $30,000 in credit card debt to fund the launch of Engineers Without Borders Canada (EWB) – that turned out to be a good decision. As EWB’s co-founders, George and friend/colleague Parker Mitchell stewarded the organization from an idea scribbled on a napkin to global influence with 3,000 active members, 50,000 supporters, 37 chapters in Canada and change ventures in Malawi, Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, and Zambia.</p>
          <p>George is now the sole CEO of an organization with volunteers and staff that have been embedded in more than 150 African businesses, governments and organizations. They drive EWB’s change ventures, working to help local leaders and entrepreneurs create bottom-up, disruptive innovations that address systemic causes of poverty. EWB is also a ‘torch’ for engineers and social change in Canada. George and Parker believed that the engineering profession had a greater role to play in society, and that EWB could lead a movement of socially-minded engineers. EWB’s Canadian change ventures include Canada’s largest grassroots advocacy network on international issues and partnerships to change undergraduate curriculum for 20,000 students, transforming them into Global Engineers.</p>
          <p>Through EWB, George inspires an ever-growing network of change leaders who are dedicated to making disruptive, positive change. He was awarded the Young Leaders Award by the Public Policy Forum (2007), named as one of Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 (2005) and awarded the prestigious Action Canada Fellowship (2004) on public policy. He’s was also recognized by Time magazine as one of Canada’s next generation of social leaders (2001).</p>
          <p>George holds a Bachelor of Applied Science from the University of Waterloo (1999), a Bachelor of Applied Studies (Honorary) from Seneca College (2009) and a Doctorate of Applied Science (Honorary) from Queen’s University. When he’s not out trying to change the world, he’s relaxing at home or canoeing with his wife Sari and his golden retriever Coel. And he still doesn’t have his Master’s.</p>
